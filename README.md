# BeeGUTS

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of BeeGUTS is to analyse the survival toxicity tests performed
for bee species. It can be used to fit a Toxicokinetic-Toxicodynamic
(TKTD) model adapted for bee standard studies (acute oral, acute
contact, and chronic oral studies). The TKTD model used is the General
Unified Threshold model of Survival (GUTS).

## Installation

You can install the released version of BeeGUTS from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("BeeGUTS")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bgoussen/BeeGUTS")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(BeeGUTS)
#> BeeGUTS (Version 1.0.0, packaged on the: 2022-07-21 14:42:01 UTC)
#> - For execution on a local, multicore CPU with excess RAM we recommend calling
#>       options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()-1)
#> - In addition to the functions provided by 'BeeGUTS', we recommend using the packages:
#>    - 'bayesplot' for posterior analysis, model checking, and MCMC diagnostics.
#>    - 'loo' for leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) using Pareto smoothed
#>        importance sampling (PSIS), comparison of predictive errors between models, and
#>        widely applicable information criterion (WAIC).
file_location <- system.file("extdata", "betacyfluthrin_chronic_ug.txt", package = "BeeGUTS") # Load the path to one of the example file
lsData <- dataGUTS(file_location = file_location, test_type = 'Chronic_Oral') # Read the example file
plot(lsData) # Plot the data
#> [[1]]
```

``` r
fit <- fitBeeGUTS(lsData, modelType = "SD", nIter = 2000) # Fit a SD model. This can take some time...
#> Warning: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
#> Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
#> https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bulk-ess
#> Warning: Tail Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior variances and tail quantiles may be unreliable.
#> Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
#> https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#tail-ess
traceplot(fit) # Produce a diagnostic plot of the fit
```

``` r
plot(fit) # Plot the fit results

```

``` r
summary(fit) # Gives a summary of the results
#> Summary: 
#> 
#> LC  calculation. 
#>  Time for which the LCx is calculated: 
#>  Bee species: 
#>  Test type: 
#>  LCx:
validation <- validate(fit, lsData) # produce a validation of the fit (here it uses the same dataset as calibration as an example, so not relevantâ€¦)
#> Note that computing can be quite long (several minutes).
#>   Tips: To reduce that time you can reduce Number of MCMC chains (default mcmc_size is set to 1000).
plot(validation) # plot the validation results
```

``` r
dataPredict <- data.frame(time = c(1:5, 1:15), conc = c(rep(5, 5), rep(15, 15)),  replicate = c(rep("rep1", 5), rep("rep3", 15))) # Prepare data for forwards prediction
prediction <- predict(fit, dataPredict) # Perform forwards prediction. At the moment, no concentration recalculation is performed in the forwards prediction. The concentrations are taken as in a chronic test
plot(prediction) # Plot of the prediction results
